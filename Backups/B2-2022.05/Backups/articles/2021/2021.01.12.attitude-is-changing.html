              Many elders once told me that the radiation of using computer is so heavy, I did not think its side effect could really do my body a harm.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, theses days, I feel it and begin to know the reason why I did not think its radiation matters before. Because we regards the electronic equipment as the favorite toy which symbolizes the Pandora's box is opening under our handles when we operate it. But as we spend 16 hours from the 24 of a single day with our favorite PC and in the next few days(could be a week concretely), we do the same so. Maybe you will own a profoundly different feeling as I got when you tried this, but I got something to say: if you spent the time with computer just for your work, and the phenomenon has already successively lasted more than a week even more in your reality, you are very likely to agree and understand the words thoroughly: Computer is the tool more than its part of toy. And we do not be those loving playing kids anymore, although almost everyone of us wants to be from the bottom of our hearts.
            </p>

              But just as for myself, the days of using PC like playing the toys seems that it has already gone.
