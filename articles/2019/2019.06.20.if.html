      ‘IF’ is another circumstance, when we talk about ‘IF’ ,it mostly means there’s a regret as reality in life will never permit ‘IF’ to be true .After taking CET4 ,I get more comprehending about this: it’s one man‘s ability makes things easy, not luck .Of course luck is also important especially when you haven’t prepared well completely , but when it comes to a man’s achievements , ability is the most valuable  information that people want to know .Because there is less likelihood for them to get the luck ,instead of the ability ,which usually could be trained in some ways .However, I do not agree with the way of saying that ability makes everything possible ,which is to say that there are always some things we can’t get just by efforts .For instance, the creativity, one of the most significant abilities which has been bringing people a lot of surprises and conveniences in our modern society .

      My most favorite sentence which is relevant to ‘IF’ is :If no if，it just passed.
