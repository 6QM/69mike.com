    <p>
      In China , any great thinkings shouldn’t be born for the gravity of life’s reality is so heavy .All I have done are seemingly just for my future to find a good job and marry a nice girl who will give a birth to the family , and live a simple life from the beginning to the end of my life. Of course, I also need to raise my parents when I find a job . Once I was a little boy who rarely liked thinking too much about the meaning of life , but now things change . With ages growing , I’m extremely loving to think the endless things about life , especially which are related to the meanings of my existence . This behavior brings me both happiness and pains. But the most of thinkings not only stop my steps towards my future, but also waste time of my living . I can’t get rid of it , because I’m being enslaved firmly . So there is a question I really wanna figure it out:Even if having done nothing wrong to this world , why is me ?
